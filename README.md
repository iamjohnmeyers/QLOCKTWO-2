A QLOCKTWO is a modern horological art peice. Instead of looking at hands on a clock or reading numbers, you can simply read the time. Like this: It is five to seven.

I love the aesthetic of a QLOCKTWO. The problem: they are **very expensive**. I wanted to create something similar, but not spend thousands of dollars buying a QLOCKTWO. So I decided to make my own, with software.

## The Software
- A python webserver
- p5.js as a graphics engine
- Firefox running in kiosk mode
- Debian Linux

The laptop is running an instance of Debian Linux set to launch this web app (in kiosk mode) on startup.

## The Hardware

- A Cheap 43" Insignia TV from a Best Buy outlet center
- A smart WiFi outlet with Google Assistant integration
- A Lenovo laptop velcroed to the back of the TV

I originally used a Libre Computer Le Potato to run this application, but after experiencing issues with the GUI soft locking, I transitioned over to a cheap 11" Lenovo laptop with an Intel Atom chip. I haven't had problems since.
